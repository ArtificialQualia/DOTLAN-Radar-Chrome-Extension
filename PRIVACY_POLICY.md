For the chrome extention DOTLAN ESI Radar

Contact us at: https://github.com/ArtificialQualia/DOTLAN-Radar-Chrome-Extension/issues

As a chrome extention, DOTLAN ESI Radar is required to tell you by Google Chrome that:

## We do NOT collect your data
'We' and 'us' being anyone who is behind DOTLAN ESI Radar or works on it.  
There is literally no infrastructure behind DOTLAN ESI Radar that could store your data.  No servers, no cloud stuff, nothing.  
It just lives in your own browser, stores some stuff in your own browser, makes requests from your own browser, etc.  
That's all there is to it.

If you have questions about this very complicated privacy policy, use the contact link at the top.
